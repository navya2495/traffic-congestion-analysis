    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project investigates how traffic congestion affects taxi trip durations and fares across New York City. It also explores spatial and temporal variations in congestion and applies various modeling techniques for prediction.</p>

      <li>Average trip durations and fares by neighborhood</li>
      <li>Computed for both pickup and dropoff areas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>

    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
  
    <h3>Spatial Analysis</h3>
    <p>The neighborhood with the highest average trip duration. This graph highlights the neighborhoods that tend to have longer ride durations on average, which could be influenced by factors such as their distance from popular destinations, traffic patterns.

        Average fare for pick ups in different neighborhoods.
        .</p>
  
    <h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>
    <p>Hourly Trip Duration:
        The trip duration peaks around 8-9 AM, indicating that taxi trips during the morning hours tend to take longer
        Hourly Total Fare:
        The total fare peaks around 7-8 AM, indicating that taxi trips during the early morning hours they are charging more
        Hourly Congestion Surcharge:
        The congestion surcharge exhibits a distinct peak around 9-10 AM

    </div>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Peak trip duration: 8–9 AM</li>
      <li>Peak fare: 7–8 AM</li>
      <li>Peak congestion surcharge: 9–10 AM</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Congestion Impact on Neighborhoods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>New feature created using congestion surcharge and neighborhood info</li>
      <li>Average trip duration and fare calculated per combo</li>
      <li>Shows areas most impacted by congestion</li>
      <p>Analysis of neighborhoods based on the average trip duration and total fare,  a newly created feature that combines congestion surcharge and neighborhood information.

        For each unique combination of congestion surcharge and neighborhood, the code calculates the mean of 'trip_duration' and 'total_fare' columns.

    <h2>Correlation with Congestion Surcharge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Trip duration and distance: Little to no correlation</li>
      <li>Total fare: Moderate positive correlation</li>
      <p>Trip duration and trip distance have very little to no relationship with congestion surcharge.
        Total fare has a moderate positive relationship with congestion surcharge, suggesting that higher fares may be associated with slightly higher congestion surcharges, but the correlation is not very strong.

    <h2>Modeling & Metrics</h2>
    <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High MSE and MAE</li>
      <li>Weak R² score</li>
      <p>MSE :Higher values indicate lower performance
        R- squared:Indicating a weak level of explanatory power.
        MAE:Higher values indicate lower accuracy.
        </p>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Decision Tree Regression</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>MSE: Low</li>
      <li>R²: 0.32</li>
      <li>MAE: Low</li>
      <p>MSE :Lower values indicate better performance
        An R-squared of 0.32 means that 32% of the variance in the fare amount is explained by the model.​
        MAE:Lower values indicate better accuracy
        </p>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Random Forest Regression</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Best performance overall</li>
      <li>Lowest error, highest R²</li>
      <p>MSE:Lower values indicate better performance.​
        R-squared:Indicating a moderate level of explanatory power.​
        MAE:Lower values indicate better accuracy.​
        The Random Forest Regression model is performing​
             the best among the three models based on the provided​
             metrics. It offers the lowest errors and the highest ​
             explanatory power.
